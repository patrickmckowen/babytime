# Baby Time

## The Problem

New parents are exhausted and overwhelmed. The tools meant to help them—feed trackers, sleep trackers—are fragmented, cluttered, and slow. They add cognitive load instead of removing it.

## Core Belief

Know what's next without thinking. Calm tools for chaotic days.

## What This Is

A single app that answers one question: *What does my baby need next, and when?*

- Tracks feeding (time, volume, breast/bottle) and sleep only
- Shows the next activity at a glance with supporting context
- Calculates goals based on the child's age
- Supports multiple caregivers with real-time sync

## What This Isn't

- No activity types beyond feed and sleep
- No gamification, streaks, or badges
- No social features beyond caregiver sharing
- No ads, ever
- No complexity that doesn't serve the core question

## Principles

**Anticipatory over informational.**
Tell parents what's next, not just what happened.

**Forgiving by design.**
Timers can be started late, edited retroactively, adjusted. Life with a newborn is messy.

**Calm confidence.**
Reduce anxiety, never add to it. The app should feel like a quiet, competent partner.

**Minimal, not empty.**
Every element earns its place. Thoughtful details reward attention without demanding it.

**One-handed, half-asleep.**
Design for 3am, one arm holding a baby, brain at 40%.

## Key Scenarios

1. **The glance** — Parent wakes, checks phone, instantly knows if baby should eat or sleep soon
2. **The forgotten timer** — Feeding started 10 minutes ago, parent remembers, starts timer and adjusts start time back
3. **The handoff** — Partner takes over, opens app, has full context without a conversation
4. **The check-in** — Quick look at daily progress toward feed/sleep goals

## Scope Boundaries

- iOS native (Lock Screen widgets and Live Activities are future milestones)
- Multi-caregiver real-time sync is core, not an add-on
- Theming supported via semantic design tokens
